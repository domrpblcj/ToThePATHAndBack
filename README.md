ToThePATHAndBack
================

Android application that will give directions to your nearest entrance at your nearest PATH station.

In this repository are the source files for a new Android application that I'm working on. The plan is to have a initial relase that will obtain the user's location and direct them to the nearest entrance and their three nearest PATH stations.

The code is a bit sloppy, and I haven't really spent much time on commenting because I still was on the fence about making my project open to the public. Over time I will populate the code with proper commenting.
