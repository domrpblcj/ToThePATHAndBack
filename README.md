================

This project is an Android application that will give directions to your nearest open entrance at your nearest Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) subway system.  (PATH runs between New York City and New Jersey) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Authority_Trans-Hudson

In this repository are the source files for an Android application, which obtains the user's location and direct them to the nearest entrance of their three nearest PATH stations. It also gives a schedule, system map, and system advisories. 

Over time, there will be new features added such as directions within the system (station-to-station), get you from your final station to your destination, and others. This will also expand to include NYC subway, NJ Transit rail and light rail, MTA Metro North and Long Island Rail Road. My hope is to have this a one-stop shop for all your rapid transit needs in the NYC area.

You need to download and import the Google Play Services library.
