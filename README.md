================

This project is an Android application that will give directions to your nearest entrance at your nearest Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) subway system.  (PATH runs between New York City and New Jersey) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Authority_Trans-Hudson

In this repository, are the source files for a new Android application. The plan is to have a initial relase that will obtain the user's location and direct them to the nearest entrance of their three nearest PATH stations.

The code is a bit sloppy, and needs more comments including more JavaDoc comments.
